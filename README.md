## In the console

The console will print out the current (decompressed state) and also show the compressed values (whenever the state changes).

On the `COMPRESS` output, we see `MzRAAcYA`, `16` and `8`. The garbbled text is the compressed value, and the counts are of decompressed and then compressed bytes. This means we only need 8 bytes to store our full 16 byte number!! ðŸŽ‰

```bash
DECOMPRE MzRAAcYA 1000000000000003 8 1
CURRENT STATE 1000000000000003
COMPRESS 1000000000000003 MzRAAcYA 16 8
```
